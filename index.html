    <p>Happy birthday Nada,  </p>
    <p>On this day 19 years ago a ray of hope was born. Turning 19 is a big milestone, specially when it is someone like you, that made such a positive difference for the people in your life all the time. Mabrook on finally becoming 19, you are really an amazing friend and thank you for being there in times of need (I hope you had a dope ass birthday party).
    You really are Noble , Admirable , Determined & Affectionate in every way. I hope this year & every year treats you well. . </p>
    <p>-With love, Omar</p>
